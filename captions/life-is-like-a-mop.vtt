00:04.220-->00:07.500
<v Stanley>George, my friend, he gave me this mop!

00:07.300-->00:12.050
<v Stanley>It's a pretty good mop!
<v Stanley>It's not as good as my first mop.
<v Stanley>I miss my first mop.

00:12.200-->00:14.050
<v Stanley>But this is still a good mop!

00:15.020-->00:17.100
<v Stanley>Sometimes ya hafta take what life gives ya

00:18.000-->00:20.000
<v Stanley>'cause life is like a mop!

00:20.100-->00:26.200
<v Stanley>And sometimes life gets full of dirt and crud and bugs and hairballs and stuff

00:26.300-->00:29.000
<v Stanley>You.. You gotta clean it out!

00:29.000-->00:33.500
<v Stanley>You, you gotta put it in here and rinse it off and start all over again and

00:33.500-->00:39.500
<v Stanley>and sometimes life sticks to the floor so bad you know a mop, a mop it's not good enough

00:39.900-->00:42.900
<v Stanley>It's not good enough!
<v Stanley>You gotta get down there, like, with a toothbrush, ya know

00:43.000-->00:46.500
<v Stanley>And you gotta, you gotta really scrub 'cause you gotta get it off.

00:46.500-->00:48.000
<v Stanley>You gotta really try to get it off.

00:48.000-->00:51.050
<v Stanley>But if that doesn't work, that doesn't work, you can't give up.

00:51.060-->00:53.300
<v Stanley>You gotta, you gotta stand right up.

00:53.350-->00:55.070
<v Stanley>You gotta run to a window and say,

00:55.070-->01:00.000
<v Stanley>"Hey! These floors are dirty as hell, and I'm not gonna take it anymore!"

01:00.500-->01:08.100
<v Crowd>Cheering wildly in ovation of Stanley's beautiful speech
